# brain-tumor-autosegmentation-for-mri-with-unet
AI has several use cases in medicine and in this repository, I try to document a recent learning I had in a course I took on Coursera, AI for Medical Diagnosis by DeepLearning.ai. 
Here, I present how to implement unet from scratch using PyTorch and a tensorflow implementation of brain tumour autosegmentation of MRI scans.
